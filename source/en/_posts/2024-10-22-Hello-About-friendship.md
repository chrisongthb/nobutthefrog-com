A song about friendship, the third harbinger of the upcoming album "Right where you are".<!--more-->

As we always spend several months travelling in winter, we don't see our friends and family for a long time, which can sometimes be very painful. A phone call or a quick WhatsApp message quenches our longing, and yet deep in our hearts the fear remains that we will be "forgotten" at home or that friendships will come to nothing due to a lack of meetings. The song that Anka wrote down one New Year's Eve and Ren√© later added the verse and solo helped us to remember that friendship can easily cope with distance and time. Some great people have even visited us on our travels, which made us almost burst with joy. It's just great to share beautiful (and not so beautiful) moments with the people who mean a lot to you. So, a chapeau to our friends! It's great that you exist :))
