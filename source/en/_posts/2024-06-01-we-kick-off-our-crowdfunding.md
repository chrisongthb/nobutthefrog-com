From June 1 to July 31, 2024, we are collecting money via the “Startnext” platform for our new album “Right where you are”<!--more-->. We already have the masters of 8 songs, which we recorded last year on a few hot summer days in Anka's grandmother's barn on the edge of Franconian Switzerland. Stop by and support us with a donation!

There will be the legendary apple pie & a visit from us again, plus of course the album for pre-order and much more!

We are happy about small and big support, every Euro counts!
