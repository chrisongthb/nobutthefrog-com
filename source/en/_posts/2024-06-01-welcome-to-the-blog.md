Over time, a place is created here where we spontaneously talk about events and experiences<!--more-->, something between newsletter and Instagram stories. A blog!

Stories from everyday life as an artist duo. What exactly we will write about will evolve over time, similar to the newsletter.

I think there will be room for the big events, such as album releases, single releases, great concert confirmations, etc. We are curious :)
