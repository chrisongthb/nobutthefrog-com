A song about friendship, the third harbinger of the upcoming album "Right where you are".<!--more-->

As we always spend several months travelling in winter, we don't see our friends and family for a long time. This can sometimes be very painful. A phone call or a quick WhatsApp message quenches our longing. And yet deep in our hearts the fear remains that we will be "forgotten" at home. Or that friendships will come to nothing due to a lack of meetings. The song helped us to remember that friendship can easily cope with distance and time. The song was written on a New Year's Eve by Anka and completed a little later by Ren√© with verse and solo.

Some great people have even visited us on our travels, which made us almost burst with joy. It's just great to share beautiful (and not so beautiful) moments with the people who mean a lot to you. So, a chapeau to our friends! It's great that you exist :))
