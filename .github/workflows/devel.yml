# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy Jekyll site to Pages for development purpose

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the development branch
  push:
    branches: ["devel"]

  # Runs regularly
  # for requirements regarding schedule see also
  # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule
  # Notes:
  #  - The schedule event can be delayed during periods of high loads of GitHub Actions
  #    workflow runs. High load times include the start of every hour. If the load is
  #    sufficiently high enough, some queued jobs may be dropped. To decrease the chance
  #    of delay, schedule your workflow to run at a different time of the hour.
  #  - This event will only trigger a workflow run if the workflow file is on the default branch branch.
  #  - Scheduled workflows will only run on the default branch.
  #  - In a public repository, scheduled workflows are automatically disabled when no repository activity has occurred in 60 days.

  # UTC does not have winter-/summer time
